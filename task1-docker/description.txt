Description:
- Create a Dockerfile for a simple Node.js application that listens on port 3000. The
Dockerfile should use a lightweight base image, install dependencies, copy the
application code, and specify the command to run the application.

I have created a simple Node.js application using a Dockerfile

in our Dockerfile 
1) we will use a light-weight node image 
2) we will create a working directory for us to store our files in the container
3) next, we will copy all the JSON packages to the container
4) now we will copy the required dependencies to run our node application
5) As per the requirement, we need to host or listen to our application port 3000. we use EXPOSE
6) to run our application finally we will use CMD

using light-weight images helps to reduce image size and builds faster, and we can save some space.
to build an image: docker build -t image_name .
to use that image with a container: docker run -it --name container_name -p host_port:container_port image_name
